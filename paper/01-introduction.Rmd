In recent years, tracking data have replaced traditional box-score statistics and play-by-play data as the state-of-the-art tool in sports analytics.
Numerous sports have been collecting and releasing data on player and ball locations on the playing surface over the course of a game.
This spatio-temporal multi-resolution source of data have provided exceptional opportunities for researchers to perform advanced studies at a more complex level to deepen the understanding of different sports.
For complete surveys on how tracking data have transformed sports analytics, see @Macdonald2020Recreating, @Baumer2023Big, and @Kovalchik2023Player.

<!-- We contribute to the growing literature of research based on player tracking data in American football.  -->

In an attempt to foster analytics and innovate the game, the National Football League (NFL) introduced their player tracking system known as [Next Gen Stats (NGS)](https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/technology/nfl-next-gen-stats/) in 2016, using radio frequency identification (RFID) chips placed in players' shoulder pads (and in the ball) to collect data 10 times per second. These NGS tracking data contain information about the on-field locations, speeds, and angles of all 22 players on the field (as well as the ball). While these data were initially only available for teams, media, and vendors, in December 2018 the NFL launched the inaugural edition of their annual [Big Data Bowl (BDB)](https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/analytics/big-data-bowl/past-big-data-bowl-recaps/) competition.  

The first BDB led to several contributions largely focused on offensive performance evaluation. For example, one group of finalists introduced an approach for modeling the hypothetical completion probability of a pass aiding in the evaluation of quarterback (QB) decision making [@deshpande2020expected]. The winners of the inaugural BDB focused on identifying receiver routes via clustering techniques [@chu2020route] and convolutional neural networks [@sterken2019routenet]. Along with the BDB competition entries, the public release of NGS data allowed researchers to tackle (pun intended) a variety of other problems such as revisiting fourth down decision making [@lopez2020bigger], annotating pass coverage with Gaussian mixture models [@dutta2020unsupervised], and introducing a continuous-time framework to estimate within-play value [@yurko2020going].  Since its inception, the BDB has chosen a different theme each year leading to new insight about evaluating different positions such as running backs, defensive backs, and special teams. The [2023 edition of the NFL BDB](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023) asked participants to evaluate lineman on passing plays [@Howard2023NFL].

[I think we need a couple of paragraphs here to introduce the defensive linemen position, and the role/significance of linemen (kinda similar to section 2 of rishav's paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11373.pdf)]

In this work, using data made available in the 2023 BDB, we present a novel approach to measure the performance of pass rushers (defensive players whose role on a given play is to put pressure on the QB). Relative to other aspects of American football, such as QB evaluation [@burke2019deepqb, @reyers2021quarterback], the literature on evaluating pass rushers is scarce. Below, we provide a brief overview of existing pass rush metrics.

## Previous Pass Rush Metrics

Officially tracked by the NFL since 1982, the most well known statistic for evaluating defensive linemen on pass rushing plays is the sack, which occurs when a defensive player tackles the quarterback behind the line of scrimmage before the quarterback is able to throw a pass.  Sacks represent a simple binary measure of success for a rusher on a pass play.  However, there are many intermediate outcomes for a rusher that can also be considered successes that don't result in a sack.  Measures such a hits and hurries are collected by various outlets where hits counts the number of times a QB is hit while passing and hurries counts how often a QB has to throw the ball earlier than they would have liked to.  

The sum of sacks, hits, and hurries has been defined as "pressures" (https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/advanced.htm) and is an improvement over sacks, but suffers from problems of subjectivity (e.g. was the play actually a hurry?) and are still binary outcomes (i.e. There is a continuum of plays that aren't hurries that all counted as simply "not hurries").  

Pro football focus (PFF) defines pass-rush productivity as: 
$$
\frac{\frac{1}{2}(\# Hurries + \# Hits) + \# Sacks}{\#PassRush Snaps}
$$.


This metric gives twice as much weight to a sack relative to hurries and hits, which is a slight improvement, but the choice of weights is ad-hoc an still only measures binary outcomes similar to the shortcomings of previously discussed metrics.   (https://www.pro-football-reference.com/about/advanced_stats.htm)

More recently metrics such as Time In Pocket (TIP) and Pass Rush Win Rate [@Burke2018Created] (PRWR) have also been proposed and are substantial improvements over the less sophisticated counting statistics.  However, these are still imperfect measures as TIP is highly context dependent (e.g. deep vs shallow passing routes).  PRWR is based on whether a pass rusher is able to beat their block before a fixed time (ESPN chooses 2.5 seconds) from the snap, but this is highly dependent on the rather arbitrary choice of time used to define a "win".  In addition, once a cut-off is chosen, this metric becomes binary like most of the previously discussed measures.

All of these measures represent different versions of "the best we can do with the available data".  Without more sophisticated data (i.e. player tracking data), it is difficult to measure effectiveness of a pass rusher so many simple metrics of success have been proposed.  Table \ref{tab:metrics} gives a summary of existing pass-rush metrics.

<!-- ## Previous Pass-Rush Measure in academic literaure -->

## Previous Research on Football Linemen

The literature on the performance of linemen, either offensive or defensive in football is scant. @AlamarGould2008 studied the the relationship between pass completion rate and performance of offensive linemen in terms of how successful they were at blocking.  The data for this study was collecting essentially by hand by watching and charting the performance of each lineman on a play.  This was done using games from the beginning 2007 season for seven teams and their first three games each.  The authors note that there is not much research on linemen saying "One of the principal reasons for this lack of study is the absence of publicly available data that is needed in order to track the performance of a specific lineman." 

Later, @AlamarGoldner2011 again studied offensive linemen performance.  They analyzed 20 teams during the 2010 season for a total of 1,259 plays.  They don't estimate the performance of an individual lineman, but rather positions on a team (e.g. Chicago Bears' left tackle, Pittsburgh Steelers' center, etc.).  They then go on to use a survival analysis model to estimate time in pocket.  The average probability of success from the survival model is then used as a covariate in a model to estimate the probability of competing a pass, and they show that there is a significant relationship between these two probabilities.  

## Contributions of STRAIN

All the aforementioned methods suffered from not having the data that was actually necessary to develop a meaningful metric for linemen in football, either offensive or defensive.  Now though, thanks to the 2023 Big Data Bowl, we have a publicly available tracking data not only for the linemen, but for every player on the field!  With this data performance of offensive and defensive linemen can be meaningfully assessed, though we focus solely on the performance of defensive linemen here.  This manuscript presents a metric we refer to as STRAIN based on a concept of the same name from materials science.  STRAIN gives a continuous measure of pressure for each of the defensive linemen over the course of an entire play allowing for the measurement of the level of success of the pass rush even on plays that don't result in an easily observed outcome like a sack, hit, or hurry.  We view this as a major step forward in the accurate evaluation of defensive linemen performance.  Further, we note than while we focus exclusively on defensive linemen here, the proposed metric STRAIN is relatively easily extended to the evaluation of offensive linemen performance.  

The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows. Section \ref{sec:data} describes the data set from the 2023 Big Data Bowl.  Section \ref{sec:methods} introduces the formal definition of STRAIN.  Section \ref{sec:results} studies the performance of the proposed metric.  We end with Section \ref{sec:discussion} where we present a discussion of future directions for STRAIN.

<!-- @AlamarGould2008: Abstract: Protecting the quarterback is an integral part of the passing game in the National Football league, yet the relationship between the abilities of an individual lineman and the effectiveness of a passing game remains unexplored. One of the principal reasons for this lack of study is the absence of publicly available data that is needed in order to track the performance of a specific lineman. In order to create the relevant data, the first 3 games of the 2007 NFL season for seven different teams were charted. The performance of each lineman was recorded on every pass play, as well as the amount of undisturbed time the quarterback was given (time in the pocket) to make a throw. These data were used in a series of regressions to determine how likely a lineman was to successfully hold his block in relation to the time it took for the quarterback to throw the ball, for each lineman in the sample. These data were also used to estimate the correlation between successful blocking and completion rate. The results of these regressions were then used to simulate the effects that different linemen have on the passing game. The trade in the offseason between the New York Jets and Washington Redskins which sent left guard Pete Kendall to Washington was examined. The analysis finds that the Jets lost approximately 3 percentage points on their completion rate due to the trade. -->
