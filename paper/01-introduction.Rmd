In recent years, tracking data have replaced traditional box-score statistics and play-by-play data as the state-of-the-art tool in sports analytics.Numerous sports have been collecting and releasing data on player and ball locations on the playing surface over the course of a game.
This spatio-temporal multi-resolution source of data have provided exceptional opportunities for researchers to perform advanced studies at a more complex level to deepen the understanding of different sports.
For complete surveys on how tracking data have transformed sports analytics, see @Macdonald2020Recreating, @Baumer2023Big, and @Kovalchik2023Player.

We contribute to the growing literature of research based on player tracking data in American football. The National Football League (NFL) introduced their player tracking system known as [Next Gen Stats (NGS)](https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/technology/nfl-next-gen-stats/) in 2016, using radio frequency identification (RFID) chips placed in players' shoulder pads (and in the ball) to collect data 10 times per second. These NGS tracking data contain information about the on-field locations, speeds, and angles of all 22 players on the field (as well as the ball). While these data were initially only available for teams, media, and vendors, in December 2018 the NFL launched the inaugural edition of their annual [Big Data Bowl (BDB)](https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/analytics/big-data-bowl/past-big-data-bowl-recaps/) competition.  

The first BDB led to several contributions largely focused offensive performance evaluation. For example. finalists @deshpande2020expected introduced an approach for modeling the hypothetical completional probability of a pass aiding in the evalaution of quarterback (QB) decision making. The winners of the inaugural BDB focused on identifying receiver routes via clustering techniques [@chu2020route] and convolutional neural networks [@sterken2019routenet]. Along with the BDB competition entries, the public release of NGS data allowed researchers to tackle a variety of other problems such as revisiting fourth down decision making [@lopez2020bigger], annotating pass coverage with gaussian mixture models [@dutta2020unsupervised], and introducing a continuous-time framework to estimate within-play value [@yurko2020going]. Since its inception, the BDB has changed themes each year leading to new insight about evaluating different positions such as running backs, defensive backs, and special teams. The [2023 edition of the NFL BDB](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023) continued this revolving theme by asking participants to evaluate lineman on passing plays.

In this work, using data made available in the 2023 BDB, we present a novel approach to measure the performance of pass rushers (defensive players charging the QB). Relative to other aspects of American football, such as QB evaluation [@burke2019deepqb, @reyers2021quarterback], the literature on evaluating pass rushers is scarce. Below, we provide a brief overview of existing pass rush metrics.

Sacks, hits, hurries, pressures

Officially tracked by the NFL since 1982, the most well known statistic for evaluating defensive linemen on pass rushing plays is the sack, which occurs when a defensive player tackles the quarterback behind the line of scrimmage before the quarterback is able to throw a pass.

Pressures: QB pressures (hurries + knockdowns + sack plays). Note that "sack plays" in this instance include both sacks and assists.

Hurried: Times QBs were hurried - defined as a situation when the QB is forced to throw the ball earlier than intended or is chased around/out of the pocket as the result of defensive pressure

Hit: Times QBs were hit - occurs when the QB hits the ground after a throw, not marked on a sack play

More recently metrics such as Time In Pocket (TIP) and Pass Rush Win Rate (PRWR) have also been proposed and are substantial improvements over the less sophisticated counting statistics. 

Pocket Time: Number of seconds the quarterback was in the pocket between the snap of the ball and a pass or the collapse of the pocket

@Burke2018Created
@AlamarGoldner2013: They talk about how there is no data available to measure offensive line performance.  1259 plays, 20 teams, 2010 season.  Success of each offensive lineman was evaluated using the best judgement of the observer.   Collected time in pocket.  They collected a bunch of binary variables and did this all by HAND!  Estimate a survival model for each position on the offensive line.  They don't rank individuals, but rather positions on a team.  They then use the predicted probability as a covariate in a model to predict completion.

2.5 seconds, arbitrary


While PRWR is certainly a step in the right direction, it takes continuous data and converts it to a binary win/loss, which is generally not recommended in statistical analysis
