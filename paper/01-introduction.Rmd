In recent years, tracking data have replaced traditional box-score statistics and play-by-play data as the state-of-the-art tool in sports analytics.
Numerous sports have been collecting and releasing data on player and ball locations on the playing surface over the course of a game.
This spatio-temporal multi-resolution source of data have provided exceptional opportunities for researchers to perform advanced studies at a more complex level to deepen the understanding of different sports.
For complete surveys on how tracking data have transformed sports analytics, see @Macdonald2020Recreating, @Baumer2023Big, and @Kovalchik2023Player.



The National Football League (NFL) introduced their player tracking system known as Next Gen Stats (NGS) in 2016

Sacks, hits, hurries, pressures

Officially tracked by the NFL since 1982, the most well known statistic for evaluating defensive linemen on pass rushing plays is the sack, which occurs when a defensive player tackles the quarterback behind the line of scrimmage before the quarterback is able to throw a pass.

Pressures: QB pressures (hurries + knockdowns + sack plays). Note that "sack plays" in this instance include both sacks and assists.

Hurried: Times QBs were hurried - defined as a situation when the QB is forced to throw the ball earlier than intended or is chased around/out of the pocket as the result of defensive pressure

Hit: Times QBs were hit - occurs when the QB hits the ground after a throw, not marked on a sack play

More recently metrics such as Time In Pocket (TIP) and Pass Rush Win Rate (PRWR) have also been proposed and are substantial improvements over the less sophisticated counting statistics. 

Pocket Time: Number of seconds the quarterback was in the pocket between the snap of the ball and a pass or the collapse of the pocket

2.5 seconds, arbitrary

While PRWR is certainly a step in the right direction, it takes continuous data and converts it to a binary win/loss, which is generally not recommended in statistical analysis
