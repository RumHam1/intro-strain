## Strain rate in materials science

In materials science, strain is the deformation of a material from stress, showing the rate of change in a material's length relative to its original length.
Formally, let $L(t)$ be the distance between any given two points of interest within a material at time $t$, and $L_0$ be the initial distance between those two points.
The **strain** for a material at time $t$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
s(t)= \frac{L(t)-L_{0}}{L_{0}}.
\end{equation}
Notice that this measure is unitless due to being a ratio of two quantities having the same dimension.

Accordingly, the **strain rate** of a material measures the change in its deformation with respect to time.
Mathematically, the strain rate of a material can be expressed as the derivative of its strain.
That is,
\begin{equation}
s'(t) = \frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{v(t)}{L_{0}},
\end{equation}
where $v(t)$ is the velocity at which the two points of interest within the material are moving away from or towards each other.
Whereas strain has no units, the strain rate is measured in inverse of time, usually 1/second.

## Application to pass rush in football

Motivated by its scientific definition, we draw a delightful analogy between strain rate and pass rushing in football.
Just as strain rate is a measure of deformation in materials science, a pass rusher's efforts involve the application of deformation against the offensive line, with the ultimate goal of breaking through the protection to reach the quarterback.
The players can be viewed as "particles" in some material and the defensive "particles" are attempting to exert pressure on the pocket with the aim of compressing and collapsing this pocket around the quarterback.

In order to apply strain rate to measure NFL pass rusher effectiveness, we make modifications to how this concept is traditionally defined.

Let $(x_{ijt}, y_{ijt})$ be the $(x, y)$ location on the field of pass rusher $j = 1, \cdots, J$ at frame $t = 1, \cdots, T_i$ for play $i = 1, \cdots, n$; and $(x^{QB}_{it}, y^{QB}_{it})$ be the $(x, y)$ location of the quarterback at frame $t$ during play $i$.

*   The distance between pass rusher $j$ and the quarterback at frame $t$ during play $i$ is 
\begin{equation}
f_{d_{ij}}(t) = \sqrt{(x_{ijt} - x^{QB}_{it})^2 + (y_{ijt} - y^{QB}_{it})^2}.
\end{equation}
*   The velocity at which pass ruher $j$ is moving towards the quarterback at frame $t$ during play $i$ is 
\begin{equation}
f'_{d_{ij}}(t) = \frac{df_{d_{ij}}(t)}{dt}.
\end{equation}
*   The STRAIN for pass rusher $j$ at frame $t$ during play $i$ is 
\begin{equation}
\text{STRAIN}_{ij}(t) = \frac{-f'_{d_{ij}}(t)}{f_{d_{ij}}(t)}.
\end{equation}
Note that to distinguish our metric from strain and strain rate in materials science, we write it in capital letters (STRAIN) for the remainder of this manuscript.

Recall that based on its materials science property, an increase in strain rate is associated with an increase in the distance between two points.
In our football setting, the two points of interest are the pass rusher and the quarterback, and we expect our metric to increase as the distance between the pass rusher and the quarterback decreases.
Thus, the negative sign in the numerator of our formula effectively accounts for this. 
Additionally, rather than keeping the initial distance ($L_0$ as previously denoted) between two points constant over time, we update the initial position to be the player locations at the beginning of each frame.
This effectively gives us the STRAIN for each frame throughout a play.

Since we only observe the distance and velocity quantities discretely in increments of 10 frames/second, a point estimate for our proposed metric STRAIN for pass rusher $j$ at frame $t$ during play $i$ is 
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\text{STRAIN}}_{ij}(t) = \cfrac{-\cfrac{f_{d_{ij}}(t) - f_{d_{ij}}(t - 1)}{0.1}}{f_{d_{ij}}(t)}.
\end{equation}
Notice that this quantity increases in two ways: 1) the rate at which the rusher is moving towards the quarterback increases, and 2) the distance between the rusher and the quarterback gets smaller.
Both of these are indications of an effective pass rush attempt.
Finally, our statistic STRAIN is measured in inverse second, similar to strain rate.
In addition, the reciprocal of our metric (1/STRAIN) has a straightforward interpretation:
it illustrates the amount of time required for the rusher to get to the quarterback at the current location and rate at any given time $t$.

## Average STRAIN

## Multilevel Model

While average STRAIN appears to be positively correlated with pass rusher ability, the observed average STRAIN on a single play is likely due to a convolution of factors. Outside of the pass rusher's ability, there is variability in the opposing strength of pass blockers across plays a pass rusher is involved. Additionally, based on previous work by PFF, the opposing QB plays an important role on observed pressure in passing plays [@eager2019pressure]. Thus, we need to appropriately divide the credit of an observed average STRAIN across the different players involved and other factors.

We use a multilevel model (i.e., hierarchical, random-effects, or mixed effects model) to evaluate pass rushers' impact on the average STRAIN observed in a play, while accounting for their pass blocker, QB, and play-level information. We identify the pass blocker linked with the pass rusher of interest using the data provided by PFF. Since there can be multiple blockers linked to a rusher, for simplicity we only consider the nearest blocker positioned to the pass rusher at the start of the play. We use random intercepts for the three player groups: (1) pass rushers as $R$, (2) nearest pass blockers as $B$, and (3) QBs as $Q$. The coefficients $\beta$ for additional information $X_{j,i}$ about pass rusher $j$ in play $i$ are estimated as fixed-effects. Our model for the average STRAIN by pass rusher $j$ on play $i$ is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\overline{STRAIN}_{j,i} &\sim Normal(R_{r[j,i]} + B_{b[j,i]} + Q_{q[i]} + X_{j,i} \cdot \beta, \sigma^2), \text{ for } i = 1, \dots, n \text{ plays} \\
R_{r} &\sim Normal(\mu_R, \sigma^2_R), \text{ for } r = 1, \cdots, \text{ \# of pass rushers}, \\
B_{b} &\sim Normal(\mu_B, \sigma^2_B), \text{ for } b = 1, \cdots, \text{ \# of pass blockers}, \\
Q_{q} &\sim Normal(\mu_Q, \sigma^2_Q), \text{ for } q = 1, \cdots, \text{ \# of QBs}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We use a Normal distribution to pull the random intercepts for each player toward their respective position group means. This provides us with average individual effects on STRAIN for each player while applying shrinkage, which is a useful property in this problem's context since we do not observe the same number of plays for each player. With regards to the fixed-effects about pass rusher $j$ in play $i$, we include the length of the play, the pass rusher position (INSERT POSITIONS), the nearest pass blocker's position (INSERT POSITIONS), and the number of pass blockers assigned to the pass rusher according to PFF. We fit the model using penalized likelihood via the `lme4` package in `R` [@bateslme4].
